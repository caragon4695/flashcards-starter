# Prototype FlashCards

## Abstract

This solo project uses all class files to give the user 30 flash cards with questions and possible answers about JavaScript protoypes. The user can choose from the given answers and the percentage of correct answers is given at the end. This project was great practice for working with JavaScript classes and creating testing suites.
